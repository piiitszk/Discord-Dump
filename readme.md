# Discord Server Dumper

A tool to copy and recreate a Discord server

## Attention

The excessive use of the tool may result in suspicious activity, leading to the need for a password change (Discord's own security).

The tool and its creator are not responsible for improper use.

## FAQ

#### Is it possible to copy messages?

No. Discord doesn't allow reading of private channels.

#### Can private channels be copied?

Yes. All private channels will be copied.

#### Why are only categories, text, and voice channels copied?

Currently, I prefer to copy only these three types, but in the future, who knows, I might make it compatible with other channel types.

#### How can I suggest an update?

You can suggest an update or software on my Discord, just add "piitszk".
